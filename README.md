# DailyNewsReport
Welcome to the Daily News Report, an application that analyzes the Top 20 trending articles across the general and business headlines.

## Steps
While this application is not being hosted 24/7, feel free to copy the code and replicate this. Essentially how it works is that you run the main.py file through the command 
'fastapi dev'. This will run the API framework on your host to where you can hit this endpoint '{host}/register?email={your email here}'. This will add your email to a csv file within the project which will effectively sign you up for reports. You must also have a .env file in your directory and a News Api APIKEY for this to work and of course the necessary python libraries installed.
